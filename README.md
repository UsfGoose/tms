## Tech Stack
[Laravel](http://laravel.com/) + [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) + [React](https://react.dev/)

## Development
A local environment can be setup quickly using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/master/sail) and our docker configurations.


### Fresh Setup
Standing up the development environment after cloning the repository should follow these steps:

#### Setup [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail)
``` bash
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php84-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

Can't find `sail` in your path? Add to your bashrc/zshrc
``` bash
export PATH=./vendor/bin:$PATH
```
  
#### Copy `env` file
``` bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Up sail
``` bash
sail up -d
```

#### Setup database 
``` bash
sail artisan migrate
```

#### Install npm modules
``` bash
sail npm install
```

#### Generate APP_KEY
``` bash
sail artisan key:generate
```

#### Run Vite
``` bash
sail npm run dev
```

#### [OPTIONAL] Setup Test Data
``` bash
sail artisan dev:refresh
```
This will create test users with the following credentials:

| Email | Password |
|-------|----------|
| admin@test.com | password |
| user@test.com | password |


#### Setting up Mailpit
- Ensure Mailpit is not commented out in `docker-compose.yml`
- Visit http://localhost:8025 (or whatever you have specified in `docker-compose.yml FORWARD_MAILPIT_DASHBOARD_PORT`)
- Update the following .env settings:

``` bash
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailpit
MAIL_PORT=1025 # or whatever you have specified in docker-compose.yml FORWARD_MAILPIT_PORT
```
